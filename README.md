# Teeth Classification Project

## Project Overview
The Teeth Classification Project is an AI-driven solution designed to classify dental images into seven distinct categories. This project leverages deep learning techniques to enhance diagnostic precision in the healthcare industry, specifically in dental care. By accurately classifying teeth, this solution aims to improve patient outcomes and align with strategic goals in AI-driven healthcare solutions.

## Objectives
- **Preprocessing**: Prepare dental images for analysis through normalization and augmentation to ensure optimal conditions for model training and evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of classes to understand dataset balance and display images before and after augmentation to evaluate preprocessing effectiveness.
- **Model Development**: Build a robust computer vision model using TensorFlow capable of accurately classifying teeth into predefined categories.

## Features
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilizes techniques such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flipping to increase dataset diversity and improve model generalization.
- **Transfer Learning**: Employs a pre-trained VGG16 model to leverage existing knowledge and enhance classification accuracy.
- **Early Stopping**: Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting and optimize training efficiency.
- **Performance Visualization**: Provides visual insights into training and validation accuracy and loss over time.
